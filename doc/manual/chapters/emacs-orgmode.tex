\label{orgmode}

Emacs Org-Mode makes it convinient to edit the files that are saved in
the internal \emp{pub} format. Emacs Org-Mode folds and unfolds sections
of a file indicated with one or more \emp{*} at the press of the TAB
key.

Thus, one may easily fold/unfold paper categories and paper attributes
which simplifies editing of large publication database files.

For download and installation instructions, visit
\emp{http://orgmode.org/}.

To activate Org-Mode when \emp{.pub} files are opened, the following
lines should be added to the user's \emp{.emacs} file:

\begin{code}
(setq auto-mode-alist
      (append '(("\\.org$" . org-mode))
              '(("\\.pub$" . org-mode))
              auto-mode-alist))
\end{code}
