  title = {Dynamic Fault Tolerance with Misrouting in Fat Trees},
  year = {2006},
  abstract = {Fault tolerance is critical for efficient utilisation of large computer systems.  Dynamic fault tolerance allows the network to remain available through the occurance of faults as opposed to static fault tolerance which requires the network to be halted to reconfigure it.  Although dynamic fault tolerance may lead to less efficient solutions than static fault tolerance, it allows for a much higher availability of the system.  In this paper we devise a dynamic fault tolerant adaptive routing algorithm for the fat tree, a much used interconnect topology, which relies on misrouting around link faults. We show that we are guaranteed to tolerate any combination of less than (num\_switch\_ports/2) link faults without the need for additional network resources for deadlock freedom. There is also a high probability of tolerating an even larger number of link faults. Simulation results show that network performance degrades very little when faults are dynamically tolerated.},

  title = {Combining Source Routing and Dynamic Fault Tolerance},
  year = {2006},
  abstract = {An increasing amount of current and emerging interconnect technologies rely on source routing to forward packets through the network.  It is therefore important to develop methods for fault tolerance that are well suited for source routed networks.  Dynamic fault tolerance allows the network to remain available through the occurrence of faults, as opposed to static fault tolerance which requires the network to be halted to reconfigure it. Source routing readily supports the source node choosing a different path when a fault occurs, but using this approach, packets already in the network will be lost.  Local dynamic fault tolerance, where the packet is routed around the fault locally, would prevent much of the traffic being lost during failures, but this is cumbersome to achieve in source routed networks since packets encountering a fault will need to follow a path different from that encoded in the packet header.  In this paper we present a mechanism to achieve local dynamic fault tolerance in source routed fat trees, a topology that has widespread use in supercomputer systems, and compare it with endpoint dynamic fault tolerance. We also show that by combining the two approaches we achieve performance superior to any of the two individually.},

Our method is based on redundant paths, and it can handle single dynamic faults without the need for sending control messages. In the fault-free networks under non-uniform traffic it performs comparable to, or even better than, topology specific and non-fault tolerant routing algorithms in regular networks like meshes and tori. FRoots does not require any other features in the switches than a flexible routing table, and a modest number of virtual channels. For that reason it can be directly applied to several present day technologies like InfiniBand and Advanced Switching.},

  abstract = {  As the Internet takes an increasingly central role in our
  communications infrastructure, the slow convergence of routing
  protocols after a network failure becomes a growing problem. To
  assure fast recovery from link and node failures in IP networks, we
  present a new recovery scheme called Multiple Routing Configurations
  (MRC). Our proposed scheme guarantees recovery in all single failure
  scenarios, using a single mechanism to handle both link and node
  failures, and without knowing the root cause of the failure. MRC is
  strictly connectionless, and assumes only destination based
  hop-by-hop forwarding. MRC is based on keeping additional routing
  information in the routers, and allows packet forwarding to continue
  on an alternative output link immediately after the detection of a
  failure.  It can be implemented with only minor changes to existing
  solutions.  In this paper we present MRC, and analyze its
  performance with respect to scalability, backup path lengths, and
  load distribution after a failure. We also show how an estimate of
  the traffic demands in the network can be used to improve the
  distribution of the recovered traffic, and thus reduce the chances
  of congestion when MRC is used.},

  abstract = {Recovery of traffic in connectionless pure IP networks
has traditionally been handled by a full re-convergence of
the network state. This process operates in a time scale that is not
compatible with new real time and highly dependable services.
Recently, schemes for fast local and proactive recovery in connectionless
IP networks have been proposed. All these schemes are
designed to guarantee recovery of the failure of one component.
As IP protocols are used to carry more highly dependable services
and new wireless infrastructures are approaching, guaranteed
failure coverage of more than one failure becomes necessary. In
this paper we present and evaluate a scheme that guarantees to
handle any two concurrent failures in a network. We are not
aware of any other schemes that addresses such guarantees. We
evaluate and compare it with other known recovery schemes, and
we show how it gives substantially better recovery success rates
than the schemes designed for one fault tolerance, also for more
than two failures.},

  title = {A Survey and Evaluation of Topology Agnostic Routing Algorithms},
  year = {2008},
  abstract = {Most standard interconnect technologies that have emerged over the last decade, mainly for clusters,
are flexible with respect to network topology. This has spawned a substantial amount of research on
topology agnostic routing algorithms, and some of the developed algorithms are widely deployed. These
algorithms make no assumption about the structure of the network, thus they provide the flexibility
needed to route on a network in the presence of faulty components.

On the other hand, the advent of massive multi-core chips challenges the state of the art in
interconnection networks. The topology of choice for point to point Networks on-chip (NoC) is the
two dimensional mesh which is well understood, but the need of high yield, out of a production line for
such chips requires that they should be functional even if some components suffer from manufacturing
defects. Such defects will turn the regular topology into a slightly irregular one, making topology
dependent routing algorithms inapplicable. Also, heterogeneous multi-core chips, where different cores
could have different sizes and shapes, naturally lead to (slightly) irregular topologies.

Therefore, topology agnostic routing algorithms proposed for clusters find a new environment to be
applied since they provide the flexibility needed to route on a NoC in the presence of faulty or missing
components. Moreover, in some cases, they have been shown to perform comparably to special purpose
algorithms for regular topologies.

Unfortunately, the existing topology agnostic routing algorithms have been developed for varying
purposes, giving them different and not always comparable properties. Furthermore, the information on
these routing algorithms is scattered on different papers where they have been evaluated under different
and not comparable conditions.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of the topology agnostic routing algorithms that
have been proposed to date. The algorithms are classified with respect to their most important properties,
and their performance under equal, but varying conditions is analyzed. Thereby, we provide significant
new insight into the properties of the different routing algorithms, and give substantial support for, given
a set of requirements, finding the most suitable both for the on and off-chip environments.},

  year = {2008},
  abstract = {As the  end of Moores-law is on the horizon, power becomes a limiting
factor to the continuous increases in performance gains for
single-core processors. Processor engineers have shifted to the
multicore paradigm and many-core processors are reality. Within the
context of these multi-core, three key metrics point themselves out as
being of major importance, performance, fault-tolerance
(including yield), and power consumption.  A solution that
optimizes all three of these metric is challenging. As the number of
cores increases the importance of the interconnection network-on-chip
(NoC) grows as well, and chip designers should aim to optimize these
three key metrics.

In this paper we identify and discuss the main properties that a NoC
must exhibit in order to enable such optimizations. In particular, we
propose the use of virtualization techniques at the NoC level. The
implementation of routing algorithms for NoC is a key design parameter
in order to achieve an effective virtualization of the chip that
should also support broadcast within the virtualized context.

The intention behind this paper is for it to serve a position paper on the
topic of virtualization for NoC and the challenges that should be met
at the routing layer in order to maximize performance, fault-tolerance
and power consumption.

components of the interconnection network are fault-free at all
times. Thus, the ability to handle multiple faulty and unstable links
without interrupting the operation of the computer is more
important than ever.  This is best acheived by having the local
network nodes around the fault to transparently reroute the
traffic affected by the fault, hiding both permanent and short-lived faults.

In this paper, we present such a local dynamic
fault-tolerant routing algorithm for fat trees, and show that
it remains connected and deadlock free for up to and including
radix/2-1 arbitrary simultaneous faults.  The method requires only a simple misrouting
functionality in the downward phase and a small modification
of the selection function in the upward phase. No control messages
are required.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported
method for fat trees that provides local dynamic fault
tolerance of several simultaneous network faults,  without adding
additional hardware or additional
virtual channels. Our simulation results display a very graceful

strategy once the faulty components have recovered.  The method is
completely local and dynamic. It only requires a

Efficient reconfiguration methods are desired that allow  the network to function uninterruptedly over the course of the reconfiguration process while remaining free  from deadlocking behavior.

Packets are adaptively routed to the intermediate node and, at this node, without being ejected, they are adaptively forwarded to their destinations. In order to allow deadlock-free minimal adaptive routing, the methodology requires only one additional virtual channel (for a total of three), even for tori. Evaluation results for a 4x4x4 torus network show that the methodology is 5-fault tolerant. Indeed, for up to 14 link failures, the percentage of fault combinations supported is higher than 99.96\%. Additionally, network throughput degrades by less than 10\% when injecting three random link faults without disabling any node. In contrast, a mechanism similar to the one proposed in the BlueGene/L, that disables some network planes, would strongly degrade network throughput by 79\%.},

  year = {2004},
  abstract = {Current massively parallel computing systems are being built with thousands of nodes, which significantly affect the probability of failure. M. E. Gomex proposed a methodology to design fault-tolerant routing algorithms for direct interconnection networks. The methodology uses a simple mechanism: for some source-destination pairs, packets are first forwarded to an intermediate node, and later, from this node to the destination node. Minimal adaptive routing is used along both subpaths. For those cases where the methodology cannot find a suitable intermediate node, it combines the use of intermediate nodes with two additional mechanisms: disabling adaptive routing and using misrouting on a per-packet basis. While the combination of these three mechanisms tolerates a large number of faults, each one requires adding some hardware support in the network and also introduces some overhead. In this paper, we perform an in-depth detailed analysis of the impact of these mechanisms on network behaviour. We analyze the impact of the three mechanisms separately and combined. The ultimate goal of this paper is to obtain a suitable combination of mechanisms that is able to meet the trade-off between fault-tolerance degree, routing complexity, and performance.},

Because of the high number of components, it is critical to keep these systems running even in the presence of failures. Interconnection networks play a key-role in these systems, and this paper proposes a fault-tolerant routing methodology for use in such networks. The methodology supports any minimal routing function (including fully adaptive routing), does not degrade performance in the absence of faults, does not disable any healthy node, and is easy to implement both in meshes and tori. In order to avoid network failures, the methodology uses a simple mechanism: for some source-destination pairs, packets are forwarded to the destination node through a set of intermediate nodes (without being ejected from the network). The methodology is shown to tolerate a large number of faults (e.g., five/nine faults when using two/three intermediate nodes in a 3D torus). Furthermore, the methodology offers a gracious performance degradation: in an 8 {\texttimes} 8 {\texttimes} 8 torus network with 14 faults the throughput is only decreased by 6.49\%.},

  abstract = {Dynamic network reconfiguration is defined as the process of changing from one routing function
to another while the network remains up and running. The main challenge is in avoiding
deadlock anomalies while keeping restrictions on packet injection and forwarding minimal. Current
approaches either require virtual channels in the network or they work only for a limited set
of routing algorithms and/or fault patterns. In this paper, we present a methodology for devising
deadlock free and dynamic transitions between old and new routing functions that is consistent
with recently proposed theory. The methodology is independent of topology, can be applied
to any deadlock-free routing function, and puts no restrictions on the routing function changes that
can be supported. Furthermore, it does not require any virtual channels to guarantee deadlock
freedom. This research is motivated by current trends toward using increasingly larger Internet
and transaction processing servers based on clusters of PCs that have very high availability and
dependability requirements, as well as other local, system, and storage area network-based computing
systems.},

RRL keeps pre-calculated backup routing information in the network

recovery in the order of milliseconds.

The main strengths of our approach are its flexibility, as it is
independent of the network technology used, and its simplicity, as it
offers the network operator a simple and coherent view of the
resources available after a link failure. We also show that our scheme
scales well for networks of several hundred nodes.

  title = {Layered Routing in Irregular Networks},
  year = {2006},
  abstract = {Freedom from deadlock is a key issue in Cut-Through, Wormhole and Store and Forward networks, and such freedom is usually obtained through careful design of the routing algorithm. Most existing deadlock-free routing methods for irregular topologies do, however, impose severe limitations on the available routing paths.  We present a method called Layered Routing, which gives rise to a series of routing algorithms, some of which perform considerably better than previous ones.  Our method groups virtual channels into network layers, and to each layer it assigns a limited set of source/destination address pairs. This separation of traffic yields a significant increase in routing efficiency.  We show how the method can be used to improve the performance of irregular networks, both through load balancing and by guaranteeing shortest-path routing. The method is simple to implement, and its application does not require any features in the switches other than the existence of a modest number of virtual channels.  The performance of the approach is evaluated through extensive experiments within three classes of technologies. These experiments reveal a need for virtual channels as well as an improvement in throughput for each technology class.},

  title = {A Routing Methodology for Achieving Fault Tolerance in Direct Networks},
  year = {2006},
  abstract = {Massively parallel computing systems are being built with thousands of nodes. The interconnection network plays a key role for the performance of such systems. However, the high number of components significantly increases the probability of failure. Additionally, failures in the interconnection network may isolate a large fraction of the machine. It is therefore critical to provide an efficient fault-tolerant mechanism to keep the system running, even in the presence of faults. This paper presents a new fault-tolerant routing methodology that does not degrade performance in the absence of faults and tolerates a reasonably large number of faults without disabling any healthy node. In order to avoid faults, for some source-destination pairs, packets are first sent to an intermediate node and then from this node to the destination node. Fully adaptive routing is used along both subpaths. The methodology assumes a static fault model and the use of a checkpoint/restart mechanism. However, there are scenarios where the faults cannot be avoided solely by using an intermediate node. Thus, we also provide some extensions to the methodology. Specifically, we propose disabling adaptive routing and/or using misrouting on a per-packet basis. We also propose the use of more than one intermediate node for some paths. The proposed fault-tolerant routing methodology is extensively evaluated in terms of fault tolerance, complexity, and performance.},

  abstract = {A recent trend in interconnection network technologies is the inclusion of various mechanisms to support a variety of Quality of Service concepts. This has been necessitated by an increasing number of application areas that require some level of performance guarantees from the network for parts of its traffic. In this paper we describe and compare the capabilities and support for Quality of Service of the three most important interconnection network technology standards of today. Equalities between the technologies are explained and differences are clarified.},
