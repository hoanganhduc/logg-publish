  year = {2005},
  abstract = {In this paper we present a numerical method for the bidomain model, which describes the electrical activity in the heart. The model consists of two partial differential equations (PDEs), which are coupled to systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) describing electrochemical reactions in the cardiac cells. Many applications require coupling these equations to a third PDE, describing the electrical fields in the torso surrounding the heart. The resulting system is challenging to solve numerically, because of its complexity and very strict resolution requirements in time and space. We propose a method based on operator splitting and a fully coupled discretization of the three PDEs. Numerical experiments show that for simple simulation cases and fine discretizations, the algorithm is second-order accurate in space and time.

  abstract = {This paper describes an extension of the so-called Rush-Larsen scheme, which is a  widely used numerical method for solving dynamic models of cardiac cell  electrophysiology. The proposed method applies a local linearization of non-linear  terms in combination with the analytical solution of linear ordinary differential equations, to obtain a second order accurate numerical scheme. We compare the error and computational load of the second order scheme to the original Rush-Larsen  method. For a given error tolerance, the second order method is from nine to 500 times  faster than the original scheme, depending on the choice of model and tolerance.},

Electroanatomical mapping  systems provide the clinician with a picture of the activation sequence, from which he/she can determine where to ablate.  The purpose of this paper is to present an algorithm for incorporating data from these mapping systems into a numerical simulator of the atria.
The method is applied to 3D test problems with synthetic mapping data. Convergence to the correct solution is observed provided that a sufficient number of mapping sites are used. For our simulations, we use the monodomain model coupled with FitzHugh-Nagumo cell dynamics.},

  title = {Numerical solution of the bidomain equations - a review},
  year = {2008},
  abstract = {Knowledge of cardiac electrophysiology is eﬃciently formulated in terms of mathematical models. Most of these models are, however, very complex and thus denies direct mathematical reasoning founded on classical and analytical considerations. This is particularly the case for the celebrated bidomain model, developed almost 40 years ago for concurrent analysis of extra- and intracellular electrical activity. Numerical simulations represent an indispensible tool to study electrophysiology based on this model. However,  both steep gradients in the solutions and complicated geometries lead to extremely challenging computational problems.   The greatest achievement in scientiﬁc computing over the past 50 year was to enable solution of linear systems of algebraic equations arising from discretizations of partial diﬀerential equations in an optimal manner; i.e. such that the CPU-eﬀorts increases linearly in the number of computational nodes. Over the past decade such optimal methods have been introduced in simulation of electrophysiology. This development, together with the development of aﬀordable parallel computers, has enabled the solution of the bidomain model combined with accurate cellular models deﬁned on realistic geometries. However, in spite of recent progress, the full potential of modern computational methods has yet to be exploited for solution of the bidomain model.   It is the purpose of this paper to review the development of numerical methods for solving the bidomain model. The ﬁeld is huge, and we have to restrict our focus to the development after year 2000.},

  abstract = {Simulations of cardiac defibrillation are associated with considerable
numerical challenges. The cell models have traditionally been discretized  
by first order explicit schemes, which are associated with severe stability
issues. The sharp transition layers in the
solution call for stable and efficient solvers. We
propose a second order accurate numerical method for the 
Luo-Rudy phase 1 model of electrical activity in a cardiac cell, which
provides sequential update of each governing ODE. An \textit{a priori}
estimate for the scheme is given, showing that the bounds of the
variables typically observed 
during electric shocks constitute an invariant region for the
system, regardless of the time step chosen. Thus the
choice of time step is left as a matter of accuracy. Conclusively, we 
demonstrate the theoretical result by some numerical examples,
illustrating second order convergence for the Luo-Rudy 1 model.},
