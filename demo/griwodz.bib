  year = {2006},
  abstract = {One of the most difficult tasks when creating an online multi-player game is to provide the players with a consistent view of the virtual world despite the network delays. Most current games use prediction algorithms to achieve this, but usually it does not go beyond applying the DIS dead reckoning algorithm proposed in the mid-90s. In this paper we introduce a simulator called GLS that allows us to evaluate different aspects of DIS and its variations. We examine the impact of prediction and clock synchronization on game consistency. We also evaluate the convergence algorithm we introduce here. Furthermore we look into ways for compensating increasing delays to keep the player's view of the game state sufficiently consistent with other players.},

  abstract = {Massive multi-player online games have become a popular, fast growing, multi-million industry with a very high user mass supporting hundreds or thousands of concurrent players. In many cases, these games are centralized and every player communicates with the central server through a time-critical unicast event stream. Funcom's Anarchy Online is one of these; it is based on TCP. We find that its kind of traffic has some interesting properties that inspire changes to protocol or architecture. In these game streams, using TCP is not TCP-friendly, using TCP does not have to be slower than using UDP, and only repeated timeouts ruin game experience. Improving the latter in the sender implementation does not impose any remarkable penalty on the network. Alternatively, a proxy architecture for multiplexing could save about 40\% resources at the server, allow congestion control to work and also reduce the lag of the game.},

  abstract = {Networked   multi-player  games  constitute   a  demanding   class  of
interactive  distributed   multimedia  applications  with   very  high
commercial  relevance.  As such,  they  attract  a  growing number  of
researchers in multimedia networking.  Most games use a client-server
architecture, mainly to prevent cheating. By analyzing the traffic of such  games, we  confirm that  individual client-server  flows consume relatively little bandwidth.  Thus latency, rather than bandwidth, is the critical parameter when provisioning this class of applications.   In  order  for  commercial  game  services  to  ensure low-latency operation, resource reservation must be explored. In this paper, we investigate options for a DiffServ-style reservation on part of the path between a game server and sets of clients. We show  how a token bucket shaper  can be parameterized based on a target end-to-end latency, and discuss the implications for a network infrastructure.  We use the shaper to quantify the burstiness of game traffic and the correlation between individual flows, with a view to the limitations this imposes on resource reservation for aggregate (multiplexed) flows.

However, in applications with a very dynamic group management, the multicast tree will have frequent changes, and in applications that have stringent latency requirement, this operation needs to be fast. Current multicast approaches either have no notion of reconfiguration, they do not care about tree reconstruction latency or wrongly assume that this is a fast, atomic operation. In this paper, we have focused on dynamic reconfiguration and have tested different ways for a node to join a tree. Our results show that this is an important issue for the class of  highly interactive distributed applications.

  year = {2006},
  abstract = {Massive multiplayer online games (MMOGs) are today the driving factor for the development of distributed interactive applications, and they are increasing in size and complexity. Even a small MMOG supports thousands of players, the biggest support hundreds of thousands of concurrent players. Since they are typically built as strict client-server systems, they suffer from the inherent scalability problem of the architecture. Computing power and bandwidth limitations close to the server limit the possible number of players. Also, the latency of communication between players through the server will be higher than using direct communication. In the paper, we address these issues and investigate improvement options.

A typical MMOG consists of a virtual world with a concept of time and space that is similar to the real world. In it, players are represented by avatars. Only subsets of these avatars interact with each other at any given time. This allows us to divide them into groups, and communication among group members becomes a multi-party communication problem. Thus, to reduce resource consumption, we compare the performance of several algorithms for group communication with the current central server approach. We use overlay multicast as the means of providing group communication, and research algorithms for creating shortest path trees, spanning trees, delay-bounded spanning trees and, more specific, applying Steiner tree heuristics. 

Our experimental results indicate that different approaches are useful to reduce resource consumption while achieving a good perceived quality under varying conditions, such as frequent changes in group membership and the demand for low latency.

  year = {2006},
  abstract = {The popularity of distributed interactive applications has exploded in
the last few years. For example, massive multi-player online games
have become a fast growing, multi-million industry with a very high
user mass supporting hundreds or thousands of concurrent players.
Today, such games are usually client-server applications that use TCP
for time-dependent communication. Similar multimedia applications also
choose TCP frequently. Very thin data streams are sent over
each of these TCP connections, which means that they consume very
little bandwidth. TCP has several shortcomings with respect to the
latency requirements of such thin streams because of its retransmission
handling.

An alternative to TCP may be SCTP which was developed
to answer the requirements for signaling transport. SCTP has
subsequently also been considered more appropriate than TCP for
congestion controlled streaming of other time-dependent data.
Important reasons are its maintenance of packet boundaries and partial
reliability.

In this paper, we evaluate the performance of the Linux SCTP
implementation for thin streams. Like others before, we identify
latency challenges. We also propose some enhancements for reducing the
latency compared to the original Linux implementation. We argue for
separate handling of thin and thick data streams in SCTP.

the problem by defining the necessary level of consistency through
user's perception of the game. While the resulting set of

  title = {Assessment of Linux' Data Path Components for Download and Streaming},
  year = {2007},
  abstract = {Distributed multimedia streaming systems are increasingly popular due to technological advances, and numerous streaming services are available today. On servers or proxy caches, there is a huge scaling challenge in supporting thousands of concurrent users that request delivery of high-rate, time-dependent data like audio and video, because this requires transfers of large amounts of data through several sub-systems within a streaming node.
Unnecessary copy operations in the data path can therefore contribute significantly to the resource consumption of streaming operations. Despite previous research, off-the-shelf operating systems have only limited support for data paths that have been optimized for streaming. Additionally, system call overhead has grown with newer operating systems editions, adding to the cost of data movement. Frequently, it is argued that these issues can be ignored because of the continuing growth of CPU speeds.
However, such an argument fails to take problems of modern streaming systems into account. The dissipation of heat generated by disks and high-end CPUs is a major problem of data centers, which would be alleviated if less power-hungry CPUs could be used. The power budget of mobile devices, which are increasingly used for streaming as well, is tight, and reduced power consumption an important issue.
In this paper, we prove that these operations consume a large amount of resources, and we therefore revisit the data movement problem and provide a comprehensive evaluation of possible streaming data I/O paths in the Linux 2.6 kernel. We have implemented and evaluated several enhanced mechanisms and show how to provide support for more efficient memory usage and reduction of user/kernel space switches for content download and streaming applications. In particular, we are able to reduce the CPU usage by approximately 27\% compared to the best approach without kernel modifications, by removing copy operations and system calls for a streaming scenario in which RTP headers must be added to stored data for sequence numbers and timing.

Many of them have also very dynamic user groups for which all-to-all communication is needed.

We have investigated a variety of group management approaches for overlay networks in earlier work and shown that several useful tree heuristics exist. However, these heuristics require full knowledge of all overlay link latencies. Since this is not scalable, we investigate the effects that latency estimation techniques have on the quality of overlay tree constructions. We do this by evaluating one example of our group management approaches in Planetlab and examining how latency estimation techniques influence their quality. Specifically, we investigate how two well-known latency estimation techniques, \textit{Vivaldi} and \textit{Netvigator}, affect the quality of tree building.},

  year = {2008},
  abstract = {Massively multi-player online games (MMOGs) require low latency while supporting a large number of concurrent players, often sharing one worldwide instance of the game. As these are conflicting requirements, a common way of distributing load is by dividing the virtual environment into virtual regions. As MMOGs are world-spanning games, it is plausible to disperse these regions on geographically distributed servers. As such, we propose the use of core selection for finding an optimal server for placing a region, and support for migrating the game state to that server. The first goal relies on a set of servers and measurement of the interacting players latencies. In locating an optimal server, we anticipate a decrease in the overall latency for the majority of players. This reduction occurs by migrating the region to a server closer in proximity to the majority of players in that virtual region, thereby lowering the response time of any interaction.},

  year = {2008},
  abstract = {A wide range of networked games send data with very high interarrival-time between packets and with small payloads in  each packet. We call these transmission patterns ``thin streams''.  Reliability, when needed for game traffic,  is usually achieved through TCP or by using retransmission  schemes modelled on TCP. These retransmission schemes can  result in very large delays if the stream is  thin.  Viewed in the light of the time-dependent nature of game  traffic, large delays can be severely impeding  to the game experience. In order to reduce application-layer latency when packets  are lost, we have implemented modifications to TCP in the  Linux kernel. The changes are only active when thin-stream  properties are detected, thus not affecting TCP behaviour  when the stream is not thin. In this paper, we show the latency improvements from these  thin-stream modifications. As a case study, we have used  the game BZFlag to test the mechanisms, and present statistics  from these tests. The experimental results show that our modifications allow TCP  to recover earlier from packet loss. This latency reduction was then shown to improve the difference between perceived and actual player positions in the BzFlag game.},

  abstract = {Real-time delivery of time-dependent data over the Internet is challenging. UDP
has often been used to transport data in a timely manner, but its lack of
congestion control is often criticized. This criticism is a reason that the vast
majority of applications today use TCP. The downside of this is that TCP has
problems with the timely delivery of data. A transport protocol that adds
congestion control to an otherwise UDP-like behaviour is DCCP. For this protocol
,
{\it late data choice} (LDC)\~\cite{lai++2005} has been proposed to allow
adaptive applications control over data packets up to the actual transmission
time. We find, however, that application developers appreciate other TCP
features as well, such as its reliability. We have therefore implemented and
tested the LDC ideas for TCP. It allows the application to modify or drop
packets that have been handed to TCP until they are
actually transmitted to the network. This is achieved with a shared
packet ring and indexes to hold the current status. Our experiments show that we
can send more useful data with LDC than without in a streaming scenario. We can
therefore claim that we achieve a better utilization of the throughput, giving u

  year = {2008},
  abstract = {Today, major newspapers and TV stations make live and
on-demand audio/video content available, video-on-demand
services are becoming common and even personal media
are frequently uploaded to streaming sites. The discussion
about the best transport protocol for streaming has been
going on for years. Currently, HTTP-streaming is usual although the transport of streaming media data over TCP is
hindered by TCP{\textquoteright}s probing behavior, which results in the
rapid reduction and slow recovery of the packet rates. On
the other hand, UDP has been criticized for being unfair
against TCP, and it is therefore often blocked by access network providers.
To exploit benefits of both TCP and UDP, we have implemented a proxy that performs 
transparent protocol translation in such a way that the video stream is delivered to
clients in a TCP-compatible and TCP-friendly way, but
with UDP-like smoothness. The translation is related to
multicast-to-unicast translation and to voice-over-IP proxies 
that translate between UDP and TCP. Furthermore, it is
also similar to the use of proxy caching that ISPs employ to
reduce bandwidth demands. The unique advantage of our
approach is that we avoid full-featured TCP handling on
the proxy server but still achieve live protocol translation at
line-speed in a TCP-compliant, TCP-friendly manner. Although 
we discard packets just like a sender of non-adaptive
video over TCP, we achieve higher user-perceived quality
because our proxy can avoid receive queue underflows in the
proxy, while also achieving the same average bandwidth as
a TCP connection between proxy and client.
In this demo, we present our prototype implemented on
an Intel IXP2400 network processor. The prototype proxy
does not buffer outgoing packets, yielding data loss in case
of a congested TCP side. Comparing HTTP-streaming from
a web-server and RTP/UDP-streaming from a video server
shows that, in case of some loss, our solution using UDP
from the server and a proxy that translates to TCP delivers
a smoother stream at playout rate while the end-to-end TCP stream oscillates heavily.},

  abstract = {The rapid growth of the Internet multimedia services brings new
challenges to how multimedia streams can be delivered to the users
over bandwidth-constraint networks.  Different strategies
that exploit multipath streaming
in order to provide better utilization of the Internet resources

proposed by the research community.
However, there exists no metric that allows us to evaluate how close
these strategies are to the optimal resource utilization.  
This
paper proposes a static benchmarking system that models the best possible
distribution of streams along multiple paths in an overlay
network that is shared by several senders and receivers.
We have tested it with several different network topologies, and present
the test results in this paper.

  year = {2008},
  abstract = {A wide range of Internet-based services that use reliable transport protocols display what we call thin-stream properties. This means that the application sends data with such a low rate that the retransmission mechanisms of the transport protocol are not fully effective. In time-dependent scenarios where the user experience depends on the data delivery latency, packet loss can be devastating for the service quality. In order to reduce application-layer latency when packets are lost, we have implemented modifications to the TCP retransmission mechanisms in the Linux kernel. The changes are only active when thin-stream properties are detected, thus not affecting TCP behaviour when the stream is not thin. In this paper, we show the latency improvements from these thin-stream modifications. We have tested several thin-stream applications like remote terminals (SSH) and audio conferencing (Skype), and we evaluate the user experience with and without the TCP modifications. Our experimental results show that our modifications allow TCP to recover earlier from packet loss. Furthermore, user surveys indicate that the majority of users easily detect improvements in the perceived quality of the tested applications.},

  year = {2008},
  abstract = {TCP and UDP are the dominant transport protocols today, with TCP
being preferred because of the lack of fairness mechanisms in
UDP. Some time-dependent applications with small bandwidth 
requirements, however, occationally suffer from unnecessarily 
high latency due to TCP retransmission mechanisms that are 
optimized for high-throughput streams. Examples of such 
thin-stream  applications are Internet telephony and multiplayer 
games. For such interactive applications, the high delays can be 
devastating to the experience of the service.
To address the latency issues, we explored application-transparent, 
sender-side modifications. We investigated whether it is possible 
to bundle unacknowledged data to preempt the experience of packet 
loss and improve the perceived latency in time-dependent systems. 
We implemented and tested this idea in Linux. Our results show
that we can reduce the application latency by trading it against
bandwidth.},

  year = {2008},
  abstract = {General-purpose CPUs with multiple cores are established
products, and new heterogeneous technology like the Cell
broadband engine and general-purpose GPUs bring an even
higher degree of true multi-processing into the market. However, 
means for utilizing the processing power is immature.
Current tools typically assume that exclusive use of these
resources is sufficient, but this assumption will soon be invalid 
because the interest in using their processing power
for general-purpose tasks. Among the applications that can
benefit from such technology is transcoding support for distributed 
media applications, where remote participants join
and leave dynamically. Transcoding consists of several clearly
separated processing operations that consume a lot of resources, 
such that individual processing units are unable to
handle all operations of a session of arbitrary size. The
individual operations can then be distributed over several
processing units, and data must be moved between them
according to the dependencies between operations. Many
multi-processor scheduling approaches exist, but to the best
of our knowledge, a challenge is still to find mechanisms that
can schedule dynamic workloads of communicating operations 
while taking both the processing and communication
requirements into account. For such applications, we believe
that feasible scheduling can be performed in two levels, i.e., 
divided into the task of placing a job onto a processing unit
and the task of multitasking time-slices within a single processing 
unit. We have implemented some simple high-level
scheduling mechanisms and simulated a video conferencing
scenario running on topologies inspired by existing systems
from Intel, AMD, IBM and nVidia. Our results show the
importance of using an efficient high-level scheduler.},

We investigate many spanning tree problems with particular focus on reducing the diameter of a tree, i.e., the maximum pairwise latency between users. In addition, we focus on reducing the time it takes to execute membership changes. In that context, we use core selection heuristics to find well located group nodes, and edge pruning algorithms to reduce the number of edges in an otherwise fully meshed overlay. Our edge pruning algorithms strongly connect well located group nodes to the remaining group members, to create new and pruned group graphs. Such that, when a tree algorithm is given a pruned group graph, it is manipulated into creating trees with lower diameter. In the investigation presented here, we have implemented and experimentally analyzed spanning tree heuristics, core selection heuristics and edge pruning algorithms. We find that faster heuristics that do not explicitly optimize the diameter are able to compete with slower heuristics that optimize the diameter.},

  abstract = {Latency reduction in distributed interactive applications has been studied intensively. Such applications may have stringent latency requirements and dynamic user groups. We focus on application-layer multicast with a centralized approach to the group management. The groups are organized in overlay networks that are created using graph algorithms that create a tree structure for the group. A tree has no cycles and uses a small routing table, as opposed to a connected overlay mesh. We investigate a group of spanning tree problems that are referred to as Steiner tree problems, and we have a particular focus on reducing the diameter of a tree, which is the maximum pairwise latency in a tree. In addition, we focus on reducing the time it takes to execute membership changes. In that context, we use core-selection heuristics to find well-placed client nodes, and edge-pruning algorithms to reduce the number of edges in an otherwise fully meshed overlay. Our edge-pruning algorithms strongly connect well-placed client nodes to the remaining group members, to create new and pruned group graphs. Consequently, when a tree algorithm is applied to a pruned group graph, it is manipulated into creating trees with a smaller diameter.We devised new Steiner-tree heuristics that reduced the diameter, and also proposed new edge-pruning algorithms to make the tree construction faster. These heuristics and algorithms were implemented and analyzed experimentally along with several spanning-tree and core-selection heuristics found in the literature. We found
that a full-mesh of shortest paths makes it difficult for Steiner-tree heuristics to find better trees than spanning tree algorithms. The network seen from the application layer is in fact a full mesh of shortest paths. In addition, we found that faster Steiner-tree heuristics that do not explicitly optimize the diameter are able to compete with slower heuristics that do optimize it.},

As a way of enabling the group communication in distributed interactive applications we choose application layer multicast. We use simulation to evaluate several dynamic algorithms for managing overlay multicast trees. They are compared with respect to four metrics that can be relevant for a distributed interactive application. These are total tree cost, diameter, reconfiguration time and stability. We demonstrate algorithms that perform well for these metrics although they do not consider all users during reconfiguration.},

This year's MMCN is the 14th installment of the conference series. MMCN  has
traditionally served as an opportunity for researchers and practitioners  to
share their perspectives with others interested in the  various  aspects  of
multimedia systems and networks. Thanks to the outstanding  efforts  of  our
publicity co-chairs Andreas Mauthe, Wei-Tsang  Ooi,  and  Michael  Zink  and
with  the  additional  support  of  the  ACM  SIG  Multimedia,  the  program
committee had a good number of papers to choose from.

Each  original  submission  was  reviewed  by  at  least  three   reviewers,
conflicting review results were addressed in email discussions, and all  the
papers that received favorable reviews were intensely discussed  during  the
program committee's day-long meeting on  August  26,  2006,  that  committee
members attended either in person, or by IP or POTS  audio  conference.  The
average quality of submission was very high, so that we were able to  accept
18 full and seven short papers this year.

Putting together MMCN 2007 was a team effort. First of all,  we  would  like
to thank the  authors  for  their  submissions  and  for  choosing  MMCN  to
highlight their work. Our thanks also go to the  program  committee  members
and the external  reviewers  for  their  excellent  job  in  evaluating  the
submissions.  We  also  thank  the  following  colleagues  who   contributed
additional reviews: Sakire Arslan Ay, Jacob  Chakareski,  Beomjoo  Seo,  and
Leslie S. Liu. We would  further  like  to  express  our  gratitude  to  the
Computer Science department of the University of Massachusetts  that  hosted
the PC meeting, and Michael Zink in particular for being gracious  hosts  in
all aspects. We also want to thank SPIE, IS\&T, and ACM  SIG  Multimedia  for
making MMCN possible again this year.

The program addresses multimedia systems issues under the  topics  of  video
coding, systems and  measurements,  user  perception,  resource  management,
streaming scalability, multimedia systems,  and  multimedia  middleware.  In
addition to the presentation of the research papers, the program features  a
keynote speech by Ramesh Sarukkai of Yahoo! Inc.,  and  a  panel  that  will
discuss Getting in Touch with  the  Real  World  -  how  multimedia  systems
interact with physical objects. We hope  that  you  will  find  the  program
interesting and thought-provoking and that the conference will  provide  you
with a valuable opportunity to  share  ideas  with  other  researchers  from
institutions around the world!

  title = {Transparent Protocol Translation for Streaming},
  year = {2007},
  abstract = {The transport of streaming media data over TCP
is hindered by TCP's probing behavior that results in
the rapid reduction and slow recovery of the packet rates.
On the other side, UDP has been criticized for being unfair
against TCP connections, and it is
therefore often blocked out in the access networks.
In this paper, we try to benefit from a combined approach using a proxy
that transparently performs transport protocol translation.
We translate HTTP requests by the client transparently into RTSP requests,
and translate the corresponding RTP/UDP/AVP stream into the corresponding
HTTP response. This enables
the server to use UDP on the server side and TCP on the client side.
This is beneficial for the server side that scales to a higher load
when it doesn't have to deal with TCP.
On the client side, streaming over TCP has the advantage that
connections can be established from the client side, and data streams
are passed through firewalls.
Preliminary tests demonstrate that our protocol translation delivers a
smoother stream compared to HTTP-streaming where the
TCP bandwidth oscillates heavily.

particular, we compare existing user-space middleware running on top
of UDP and reliable, fair transport protocols like TCP and SCTP. In
addition, we evaluate some "low latency" extensions

  abstract = {Distributed multimedia streaming systems are increasingly popular due to technological advances, and numerous streaming services are available today. On servers or proxy caches, there is a huge scaling challenge in supporting thousands of concurrent users that request delivery of high-rate, time-dependent data like audio and video, because this requires transfers of large amounts of data through several sub-systems within a streaming node. Since the speed increase for memory accesses does not follow suite with the CPU speed, copy operations can be a severe limiting factor on the streaming performance of off-the-shelf operating systems, which still have only limited support for data paths that have been optimized for streaming despite previous research proposals. We observe furthermore that while CPU speed continues to increase, system call overhead has grown as well, adding to the cost of data movement. In this paper, we therefore revisit the data movement problem and provide a comprehensive evaluation of possible streaming data I/O paths in Linux 2.6 kernel. We have implemented and evaluated enhanced mechanisms and show how to provide support for more ef cient memory usage and reduction of user/kernel space switches for streaming applications.},
