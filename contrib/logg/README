This directory contains a snapshot of my current Publish setup.
It is included here as a demo for how Publish can be used to
organize publications, publish CVs, web pages etc. It is very
specific to how I have chosen to organize my files, but it can
be used as a template for anyone wishing to adapt it to their
own needs.

The following files are included: 

  papers.pub              The main database file
  papers/                 A directory of PDF files

  venues.list             A list of local venues generated by Publish

  publish-export-all      Script to publish all my stuff
  publish-export-bib      Script to update my bibliography
  publish-export-cv       Script to update my CV
  publish-export-html     Script to update my web page
